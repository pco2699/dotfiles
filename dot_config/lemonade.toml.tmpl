# Lemonade configuration for remote clipboard sync over SSH
#
# Lemonade allows you to sync clipboard between local and remote machines.
# Use cases:
#   - Copy text on remote machine → paste on local machine
#   - Copy text on local machine → paste on remote machine
#
# Setup:
#   1. Install lemonade on both local and remote machines
#   2. On LOCAL machine: Run `lemonade server` (or set it to start at boot)
#   3. On REMOTE machine: Configure this file and use lemonade in tmux/vim
#   4. SSH with port forwarding: `ssh -R 2489:localhost:2489 user@remote`

# macOS configuration (local machine - run server here)
port = 2489
# Uncomment to allow remote connections
# allow = ['0.0.0.0/0']

# Linux configuration (can be local or remote)
port = 2489

# If this is a REMOTE machine, configure the server address
# Uncomment and set to your local machine's IP or use localhost if using SSH port forwarding
# host = "localhost"  # When using SSH -R 2489:localhost:2489
# host = "192.168.1.100"  # Direct connection to local machine

# If using SSH port forwarding (recommended), add this to your ~/.ssh/config:
#
# Host myserver
#     HostName example.com
#     User youruser
#     RemoteForward 2489 localhost:2489
#
# Then just `ssh myserver` and lemonade will work automatically

# Line ending conversion (usually auto is fine)
# linecopy = 'auto'  # auto, lf, crlf, native
# linepaste = 'auto'

# Logging
# loglevel = 'info'  # debug, info, warn, error
